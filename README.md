# FirstJSproject

Hello, this is my very first API application.

The purpose of this project was to build a simple application listing a variety of Pokemon along with their individual attributes, sourcing the information directly from an external API.


The app has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages.


***


Key Features

● Load data from an external source (API)
● View a list of items
● On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

Requirements:

● The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
● The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
● The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
● The app must have CSS styling.
● The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
○ The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
○ The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
● The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
○ The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
● The app must not throw any errors when being used.
● The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
● The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
